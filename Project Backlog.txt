Project Backlog:

NEED (for game to be played):
- Add documentation to top of js file
- Add enemies
- Add enemy-character collision
	- remove enemy
	- drop oxygen bar by 100 (or amount remaining if less than 100) -- There's 400 width total.
- Add enemy-bullet collision
	- remove enemy
	- remove bullet
	- increase score by +5000 (or some other value)

POSSIBLE:
- Add animations for character
	- Running
	- Swimming up
	- Holding down while standing
	- Holding down while swimming
- Add enemies
	- Fish
		- swim left/right
	- Crab
		- Move along floor/platforms
	- Enemies will take oxygen when come in contact
		- Enemies will dissapear upon contact
- Make canvas bigger
	- currently 800x600. Maybe make it 1280x720.
	- it just seems super small right now.
- Moving platforms
	- the character would have to move with the platform if standing on it
	- the oxygen tanks would have to move with the platform if on top
- Move code in tick() into different methods to make tick() cleaner.
- Add more tank locations (why not)


COMPLETED THIS ITERATION
- (Aaron) Add "Drowning" aspect to oxygen bar
	- When it runs out, a second bar (red or dark blue) begins to fill up
	- Game slows down (slow down ticker)
	- Transparent red (or blue) layer appears
	- When you get a tank, it fill up oxygen bar half of the way
		- drowning bar begins to drop slowly
		- once oxygen runs out again, drowning bar begins to go up again
- (Aaron) Add Shooting
	- press SPACEBAR to shoot
	- bullets shoot in the direction the character was facing when fired
	- remove bullets when they go offscreen
	- only allow 5 bullets on screen at once
- (Ben) Increased canvas size to 1280x720
- (Aaron) Added stamina bar for shooting
	- doesn't allow to shoot when stamina bar is empty
	- requires recovery period after shooting or running out of stamina.

COMPLETED SECOND ITERATION
- (Aaron) Add Score
	- goes up over time
- (Aaron) Change oxygen bar to be on the canvas rather than using HTML
- (Ben) Add collisions with Oxygen tank
	- Add to score
	- Move oxygen tank to different location
- (Ben) Move Oxygen tank to different location
- (Aaron) Make oxygen drop faster each tank collected
- (Aaron) Make score go up more with each tank
- (Aaron) Add game over sequence
	- Allow ability to reset game


COMPLETED FIRST ITERATION
- Create canvas
- Create ocean floor
- Add background
- Add gravity
	- don't allow character to fall through ocean floor
- Make smooth keyboard controls
	- arrow keys to swim around
	- hold down to sink faster
- Don't allow character to swim above screen
- Make going left or right (out of bounds) teleport to opposite side
	- alike to pacman
- Create character sprite
- Create oxygen tank sprite
- Create remaining oxygen bar
- Make character sprite turn left and right with correct direction
- Create platforms as Rectangle Shape objects
	- If character is standing on platform, gravity does not affect
	- If player holds down, they can fall through platforms
	- player can swim up through the bottom of platforms
- Change collision with platforms into a re-usable method
- Add more platforms
