Project Backlog:

NEED (for game to be played):
- Add collisions with Oxygen tank
	- Move Oxygen tank to different location
		- Create 6 or more locations where tank can spawn
		- Randomize where tank spawns
	- Refill Oxygen bar
	- Change score (maybe increment +1)
- Add score (number of Oxygen tanks collected)
	- Maybe include time survived somehow
- Change oxygen bar to be on the canvas rather than using HTML
	(Basically, Microsoft Edge is ass but Mark will most likely use that instead of Chrome)


POSSIBLE:
- Add animations for character
	- Running
	- Swimming up
	- Holding down while standing
	- Holding down while swimming
- Add enemies
	- Fish
		- swim left/right
	- Crab
		- Move along floor/platforms
	- Enemies will take oxygen when come in contact
		- Enemies will dissapear upon contact
- Add weapon to shoot enemies
	- Shoot small circles
	- Remove circles when they hit an enemy or go off screen.
- Make canvas bigger
	- currently 800x600. Maybe make it 1280x720.
	- it just seems super small right now.
- Moving platforms
	- the character would have to move with the platform if standing on it
	- the oxygen tanks would have to move with the platform if on top



COMPLETED THIS ITERATION
- Create canvas
- Create ocean floor
- Add background
- Add gravity
	- don't allow character to fall through ocean floor
- Make smooth keyboard controls
	- arrow keys to swim around
	- hold down to sink faster
- Don't allow character to swim above screen
- Make going left or right (out of bounds) teleport to opposite side
	- alike to pacman
- Create character sprite
- Create oxygen tank sprite
- Create remaining oxygen bar
- Make character sprite turn left and right with correct direction
- Create platforms as Rectangle Shape objects
	- If character is standing on platform, gravity does not affect
	- If player holds down, they can fall through platforms
	- player can swim up through the bottom of platforms
- Change collision with platforms into a re-usable method
- Add more platforms
